# Computer Communications project

In this curricular unit we needed to do a network data transfer, just as a BitTorrent, where we had a Tracker with the network nodes' info and communication with them using TCP, and which node could transfer each others available files, or fragments, using UDP. We also implemented DNS with `bind9` .
